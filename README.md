### PTC -- Protocolo de Teoría de las Comunicaciones

PTC is a TCP-based but extremely simplified transport protocol. It was (and still is!) developed in the context of [Teoría de las Comunicaciones](http://dc.uba.ar/tc), an undergraduate course on networking of the MSc in Computer Science at the University of Buenos Aires. It is mainly aimed at providing a simple enough framework for delving into several transport-layer concepts (such as the implementation of "real" sliding window algorithms, connection establishment and maintenance, state transitions, and so forth) in a pragmatic way.
